All .py files can be executed normally like

```bash
$ python3 problem*.py
```
except for `problem0.py`, that requires arguments. The desired execution will very likely be

```bash
$ python3 problem0.py -n brown
```
or if you want to test for a specific category

```bash
$ python3 problem0.py -n brown -c adventure
```

The **required output files** are located under the `output/` folder.
