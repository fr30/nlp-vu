All Python scripts **assume the `*.txt` data files needed for this assignment are stored in a folder named `txt/` which is in the same directory**. This folder with the files is added in this repository for convenience.

All .py files can be executed normally (in an acitvated virtual environment with the requirements installed) like

```bash
$ python3 problem*.py
```
or
```bash
$ ./problem*.py
```

`problem0.py` may be used with arguments. Most comon uses will very likely be:

```bash
$ python3 problem0.py -n brown
```
or if you want to test for a specific category

```bash
$ python3 problem0.py -n brown -c adventure
```

The **required output text files** are located under the `output/` folder.

An images folder `imgs/` is created by `problem0.py` with the frequency curves of the Brown corpus.
